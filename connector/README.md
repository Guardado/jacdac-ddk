# Jacdac Connector

## PCB Edge Connector

Drawings:

* [PCB Edge connector JD-PEC-01 rev_01](JACDAC_PCB_Edge_Connector_Drawing_JD-PEC-01_rev_01.pdf)

Note that the order of pins is the same on top and bottom, or in other words pin 1 on top is above pin 3 on bottom, and vice versa.
This is because the cable (see below) has contacts only on one side, and has to work when plugged in upside-down.

You can put a via towards the end of pin 2, and use the space in the bottom to connect 1 with 3, for example as in the picture below.
