# Jacdac Module Development Kit (MDK)

The [Jacdac](https://aka.ms/jacdac) Module Development Kit (MDK) is for 3rd party hardware designers, firmware developers and manufacturers who wish to create their own Jacdac [modules](https://microsoft.github.io/jacdac-ts/devices/). 

A Jacdac _module_ communicates with other modules over the Jacdac bus using the Jacdac [protocol](https://microsoft.github.io/jacdac-ts/reference/protocol/). A module has one (or more) [Jacdac edge connectors](./connector) for connecting it to other modules using Jacdac _cables_. It may supply power to the bus and/or consume power from the bus. 

A common realization of a Jacdac module is a printed circuit board (PCB) that includes a microcontroller unit (MCU) connected to a set of **on-board components** (sensors and/or actuators), chosen by the 3rd party. The MCU firmware exposes these components via [services](https://microsoft.github.io/jacdac-ts/services/), advertised over the Jacdac bus.

The Jacdac MDK supports 3rd parties in the following steps:
1.	choosing on-board components and adding them to the Jacdac [module design](./module_design);
2.	identifying the [services](https://microsoft.github.io/jacdac-ts/services/) to represent the chosen components;
3.	[building the firmware](https://github.com/microsoft/jacdac-stm32x0) to expose the components on the Jacdac bus;
4.	[validating](./module_validation) the module;
5.	[manufacturing](./module_manufacture) the module;
6.	[submitting](./module_submit) the module to the Jacdac catalog;  

Our current hardware/firmware design and implementation targets the STM32x0 family of MCUs, including support for the Jacdac bootloader service, which allows updating of the moduleâ€™s firmware. We strongly encourage you to take advantage of the [STM32x0-based hardware design](./module_design) and [firmware](https://github.com/microsoft/jacdac-stm32x0), which will greatly simplify the above steps.

## More information

- debugging tools and tips
- adding new services is covered in README.md of [jacdac-c](https://github.com/microsoft/jacdac-c)
- detailed Jacdac requirements, for those who wish to pursue realizations of Jacdac modules using other MCUs or alternatives to MCUs.
